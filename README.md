Quite a fun entry project. Spent quite some time trying to figure out the best way for the layout and positioning of the items. I changed a few times the way I was doing things; i.e. the search bar with the nested icons/pictures. All in all, I'm happy with how my first project turned out (for now...).
Skills demonstrated:
* Use of HTML5 tags for semantics (i.e. nav, footer)
* Basic HTML structure

* General CSS styling (positioning of elements, colors, pseudo-classes)
* CSS3 layout (flexbox)
